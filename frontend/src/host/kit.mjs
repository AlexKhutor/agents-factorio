// The one door to the Application Frontend Kit. Host process only.
//
// The application loads exactly the frontend kit the backend accepted, and
// nothing else. That acceptance is recorded by two files the backend delivered
// and this project keeps byte for byte in delivery/:
//
//   delivery/contracts/<lock file>                 the lock: release, version, manifest hash
//   delivery/scripts/verify-accepted-delivery.mjs  the backend's own verifier
//
// Exactly one delivery is active. The previous one is retained next to it, whole,
// for a deliberate rollback: switching back is an edit of ACCEPTED_DELIVERY here,
// never something this module does on its own because the active one failed.
//
// Both are trusted parts of this application, not settings and not renderer
// data. Their hashes are pinned below, so neither can be edited into agreeing
// with a different kit. The order is fixed and there is no way around it:
//
//   1. the lock is read and checked against its pinned hash;
//   2. the kit directory is the one the lock names - never the newest, never a
//      fallback, never a search;
//   3. the verifier is checked against its pinned hash, and only then imported;
//   4. every kit file is verified against the accepted manifest;
//   5. only then is any kit module imported.
//
// No other module in this project imports a kit file. A failed verification is
// remembered for the life of the process: nothing is repaired, nothing is
// downloaded, and the desk opens with a local delivery error instead of a
// connection. A verified kit says nothing about the gateway: discovery, the
// expected workspace and capabilities are still checked separately.
